# KeepassMC
This mod will integrate with KeepassXC thru Browser Integration to generate password on new servers and prompt saved password.

For now only chat based login/register.


## Supported Platforms
Mod Menu is currently available for Fabric for 1.21.10, probably with some changes it can also be ported on other loaders.


## Development
I don't think this mod will be ever updated, or at least not on regular schedule. So expect this mod to broke on different version.
